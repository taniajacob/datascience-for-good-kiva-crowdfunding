The first notebook is an exploratory analysis of the data to get a feeling for what we are working with. The second notebook examines external datasets and looks at how MPI and other indicators can be used to get a better understanding of poverty levels of Kiva borrowers at a national level. The third notebook examines external data at a subnational level to see how Kiva can get MPI scores based on location at a more granular level than is currently available. The fourth notebook attepts to build a better poverty index at a subnational level by adding a financial dimension. The fifth notebook examines nightlight data as a poverty indicator.\n\nThis is the second notebook of the series. The aim here is to identify other useful ways in which poverty scores can be assigned to target Kiva borrowers. During this second stage of development, a number of external datasets were identified, which could potentially provide useful features for new indices for determining poverty. However, the majority of the datasets identified provided statistics only at a national level. This is probably not accurate enough to be helpful to Kiva as an index so the work is presented simply as a record of the author's progress and in the hope that learnings can be gained when building indices at a more detailed level.\n\n[Part I - Understanding Poverty]: https://www.kaggle.com/taniaj/kiva-crowdfunding-understanding-poverty\n[Part II - Targeting Poverty at a National Level]: https://www.kaggle.com/taniaj/kiva-crowdfunding-targeting-poverty-national\n[Part III - Targeting Poverty at a Subnational Level]: https://www.kaggle.com/taniaj/kiva-crowdfunding-targeting-poverty-sub-nat\n[Part IV - Adding a Financial Dimension to the MPI]: https://www.kaggle.com/taniaj/kiva-crowdfunding-adding-a-financial-dimension\n\n### Contents\n   1.

Conclusion  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion\"/>\n***\nThis notebook has examined a number of indicators on a national level, which are currently not included in the OPHI MPI. All of these - financial inclusion, telecommunication access and gender equality could be good additional dimensions for a new multidimensional poverty index. \n\nThe HDI, as a \"predecessor\" of the MPI was also initially examined to get an idea of what sort of correlation values are observed between these two indices in comparison to correlations between the other indicators and the MPI. The results show that indeed, the other indicators examined have much lower correlation to the MPI than the HDI and could well add value if combined into a new index."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8da04ee81dfb1ac0b13632568208e479a3daacb6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.
