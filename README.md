Data Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding

Kiva is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services to poor and financially excluded people around the world.

This notebook series is my contribution to the Data Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding challenge. The objective is to help Kiva to better understand their borrowers and build more localized models to estimate the poverty levels in the regions where Kiva has active loans.

Kiva Crowdfunding notebook series:

    Part I - Understanding Poverty
    Part II - Targeting Poverty at a National Level
    Part III - Targeting Poverty at a Subnational Level
    Part IV - Adding a Financial Dimension to the MPI
    Part V - Investigating Nightlight as a Poverty Indicator

The series in broken down into five notebooks. The first notebook is an exploratory analysis of the data to get a feeling for what we are working with. The second notebook examines external datasets and looks at how MPI and other indicators can be used to get a better understanding of poverty levels of Kiva borrowers at a national level. The third notebook examines external data at a subnational level to see how Kiva can get MPI scores based on location at a more granular level than is currently available. The fourth notebook attepts to build a better poverty index at a subnational level by adding a financial dimension. The fifth notebook examines nightlight data as a poverty indicator.
